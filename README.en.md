- **Accounts & batches**: import, filter and check account status, then organize available accounts into clear batches.
- **Workspaces & onboarding**: review subscriptions, members and seats, then invite, authorize and generate cards for the selected batch.
- **Delivery & follow-up**: copy or export cards, review redemption and recovery records, then check and confirm rotation.

## Workflow

<picture>
    <source media="(max-width: 640px)" srcset="docs/assets/readme/workflow-mobile-en.png?v=e997728a64">
    <img src="docs/assets/readme/workflow-en.png?v=f03c877403" width="100%" alt="Product architecture and workflow: operators prepare accounts, check seats, invite and authorize, then generate one card per account. Customers redeem and recover from a separate entry. Operators trace records, manually confirm rotation and prepare the next batch.">
  </picture>

1. **Prepare**: import and check accounts, then organize an available batch.
2. **Onboard**: choose the workspace and account list, then invite and authorize.
3. **Deliver**: generate, copy or export cards for customers to redeem.
4. **Follow up**: review redemption and recovery records, then check the scope and confirm rotation.

> **One card, one account. Multiple cards keep separate records.** 401 recovery retains the original account and workspace. Rotation requires manual confirmation and preserves existing delivery protections.

<a id="start"></a>

## Get started

Prepare a **Linux x86_64** host with Docker Engine (including Compose), Python 3 and OpenSSL. Run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xft0202/Apophis-TeamSeatWatch.git
cd Apophis-TeamSeatWatch
python3 deploy/manage.py start
```

The first run builds the app, prepares the configuration and guides you through setting an admin password. Wait for **“已就绪 / Ready”**, trust the local certificate as instructed, then open:

- **Admin workspace**: `https://localhost:18443/owner/`<br>
  Sign in with `owner` and your new password.
- **Customer redemption**: `https://localhost:18444/redeem/`<br>
  Redeem cards and recover from 401 errors.

**[Read the deployment & first-use guide →](docs/deployment.en.md)**<br>
These are local addresses on the deployment host. The guide covers remote access, a redemption domain and routine maintenance.
